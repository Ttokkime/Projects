### 2. A Helping Hand for Haiti Website
[A Helping Hand for Haiti](http://helpinghandhaiti.org/) is a website that informs the public about Haiti's situation and ways in which people can help Haiti. Whether it be through sending donations or by giving support to missionaries such as Youngnak Church Missionary Um, every effort is apprectiated. After all, a small action can go a long way in changing a person's life and Haiti, a country known for being one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, could use all the help that it can get. 
Using Wordpress for the base of my website design and Bluehost as a web hosting provider, I was able to create this website promoting help for Haiti.

### 3. Personal Website and Chat Bot
Under the guidance of Kevin Koh, a graduate from the University of Berkeley and a software engineer who has worked at various companies such as Google, Amazon, and now LiquiFi, taught me web development for a couple of months in the spring of 2022. With the knowledge I gained from his teachings, I was able to put together [Jamie Lee's Portfolio and Chat Bot](https://jamprofile.herokuapp.com/)

### 4. Girls Who Code Projects
Over the course of two summers, I created numerous projects with the help of the Girls Who Code organization. The portfolio, personality quiz, and activist website were made during my first summer with Girls Who Code and showcase what I learned about CSS, HTML, and javascript. The ceasar cipher related projects, the breach bot, and the cyhelp program all were projects I did during my second summer with Girls Who Code when I was learning about Python, cybersecurity, and cryptology.
